I want to do some files renaming:
I have a lot of files in: R:\Dropbox\Apps\my-photo-site
I want to find all files from R:\Dropbox\Apps\my-photo-site\b&w in other directories and if found, I want destination file name to change from
current format Name_2005_0000.jpg to Name_2005_0000_b&w_fav.jpg
Should be 2 options: 1 to run and only show which way files would be renamed (and which ones from original dir can't be found) and
2 when run with -a apply switch, should make renaming

I would want to re-run it for other dir and suffix (b&w, b&w_fav; dance, dance_fav; misc, misc_fav; portrait, portrait_fav)

add extra optional parameter -s --stat which would collect information about each file to be converted to each profile and give summary against file. It can't be selected same time as -a
Trim reporting instead or Processed:, Original. New size. Give something like:
for stat:
  fileName org: 9384x8734 343 MB x-large: 3434x23434 250 MB large: 3434x3434 343 MB med: 343x3434 333 MB small: 3434x343 222 MB x-small: 3422x444 0.55 MB
other:
  fileName org: 9384x8734 343 MB large: 3434x3434 343 MB (- applied)

and totals at the end:
for stat:
  files: 35 org: 34343 MB x-large: 250 MB large: 343 MB med: 333 MB small: 222 MB x-small: 0.55 MB
other
  files: 35 org: 34343 MB large: 343 MB (- applied)
