Can you write go script to get pins from pinterest board and assemble them to image.
Let's have new internal/pinterest which would get pinterest board URL (example: https://pin.it/7kvMjAV3t)
Configure mode: fit, compact, medium, large.
For compact try to get 6 images horizontally, for medium: 3, for large 1. For fit: make sure all images fit to single output image.
Try to pack images as tight as possible. Keep image portrait, let's try to have 1080x1920 for now, might change later.
Split to multiple images if doesn't fit.
Make optional output flag: -o path/file.jpg (make it path/file_01.jpg, path_02.jpg, etc)

Need to make a few changes:
- it only downloaded 15 pins though there are 22 pins on board
- for fit or compact - we need to fill as much of output as possible. We don't have to have 6 images across, that's only maximum
- need to be more creative with portrait and landscape images to maximise use of free space

I want to do some files renaming:
I have a lot of files in: R:\Dropbox\Apps\my-photo-site
I want to find all files from R:\Dropbox\Apps\my-photo-site\b&w in other directories and if found, I want destination file name to change from
current format Name_2005_0000.jpg to Name_2005_0000_b&w_fav.jpg
Should be 2 options: 1 to run and only show which way files would be renamed (and which ones from original dir can't be found) and
2 when run with -a apply switch, should make renaming

I would want to re-run it for other dir and suffix (b&w, b&w_fav; dance, dance_fav; misc, misc_fav; portrait, portrait_fav)

add extra optional parameter -s --stat which would collect information about each file to be converted to each profile and give summary against file. It can't be selected same time as -a
Trim reporting instead or Processed:, Original. New size. Give something like:
for stat:
  fileName org: 9384x8734 343 MB x-large: 3434x23434 250 MB large: 3434x3434 343 MB med: 343x3434 333 MB small: 3434x343 222 MB x-small: 3422x444 0.55 MB
other:
  fileName org: 9384x8734 343 MB large: 3434x3434 343 MB (- applied)

and totals at the end:
for stat:
  files: 35 org: 34343 MB x-large: 250 MB large: 343 MB med: 333 MB small: 222 MB x-small: 0.55 MB
other
  files: 35 org: 34343 MB large: 343 MB (- applied)
